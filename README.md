# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Developed a model for classifying transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent utilizing a high class imbalanced transactions dataset
Performed sampling techniques including Random Undersampling and SMOTE to effectively address class imbalance challenges
Visualized data through dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and utilized box plot along with IQR for outlier removal
Implemented Logistic Regression and SVM and employed GridSearchCV for obtaining optimal parameter settings
Concluded that LR performs best under SMOTE with a impressive recall rate of 91.3%, plotted ROC curves & confusion matrices
